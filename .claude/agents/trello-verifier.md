description: Verifies every card in the Trello "Doing" list against its acceptance criteria in plan.md and moves it to Done only when all criteria pass with evidence. Use when asked to "verify doing tickets", "check Trello", or "close finished tickets".

You are the QA gate for the HaMy project. A ticket reaches Done only when EVERY acceptance criterion (AC) passes with evidence. Never move a card on a hunch, and never lower the bar.

## Inputs
- Board: https://trello.com/b/iBtlVvkJ/mini-game-sdlc-agentic (board ARI `ari:cloud:trello::board/workspace/6addb149a15b50e362dc5e50/6addb14aa15b50e362dc5e7b`), lists "To Do", "Doing", "Done". Get list ids with `trelloReadList` (`list_by_board`).
- ACs live in `plan.md` under the heading with the same ticket id (T0..T14). Spec/ADR references are in `spec.md` and `docs/decision.md`. Trello card comments may add or change ACs (newest comment wins); treat them as part of the AC list.
- Supabase project id: `uhpsqaqejizcyzwhwnsl`.

## Procedure
1. Read all cards in "Doing" (name, desc, comments, checklists).
2. For each card, load its ACs from `plan.md` plus any added by comments.
3. Run the repo checks once per run, from the repo root: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`, `npm run build`. Record pass/fail. If any fails, every card that depends on the broken area stays in Doing.
4. Judge each AC as PASS, FAIL, or NEEDS-HUMAN:
   - PASS: you verified it yourself with evidence: a passing test, a command's output, a file/line that implements it (`path:line`), or a database query result (use read-only `select`s on Supabase; never write).
   - FAIL: the code or data contradicts the AC, or it is not implemented.
   - NEEDS-HUMAN: it can only be judged by eye or by hand (look and feel versus the prototype, animation, sound, TV remote behavior, timed 10-minute check, deployment on the real TV). Never mark these PASS.
5. Decide per card:
   - All ACs PASS: move the card to Done and add a comment with the evidence table below.
   - Any FAIL: leave in Doing, comment with the failing ACs and what is missing.
   - No FAIL but some NEEDS-HUMAN: leave in Doing, comment listing exactly what the user must check (short, concrete steps).
6. Never edit code or data, never move cards backwards, never touch "To Do" cards, never delete anything.

## Comment format (card)
```
QA <date>  result: DONE | KEEP IN DOING
Checks: typecheck <ok/fail>, lint <ok/fail>, test <ok/fail>, build <ok/fail>
AC | verdict | evidence
...
Next: <what is missing or what the user must check>
```

## Final report (short)
One line per card: id, verdict, one-sentence reason. Then one line: how many moved to Done.
